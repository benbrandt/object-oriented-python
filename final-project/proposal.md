# Programming Foundations in Python Final Project

For my Final Project, I will be creating a script that can encode movie files
based on user inputted settings to help automate the sometimes manual process
of needing to re-encode a movie for the web.

It will utilize the MoviePy project (and therefore ffmpeg) to transcode the
movies. This is a industry used toolset for high quality encoding.

The goal is for the user to run the script, be prompted with several questions
of what they need the encode to look like, and the script will create the file
for them.
